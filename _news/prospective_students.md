I am actively recruiting motivated Master and PhD students to join my research group at Tohoku University.

Students from various fields including social science, computer science, data science, and related areas are welcome to apply.

## How to Apply

- Before applying, please contact me via email and attach the following documents:
    - CV
    - Research Proposal
    - Transcript
    - Language proficiency (attach language proficiency certificates if available)
    - Personal Statement
        - Motivation for applying
        - Research experience and achievements in social science, data science, or related fields 
        - Programming experience (if none, please describe your learning plan)

- Please check the following links for detailed application procedures:
    - [Guidance for Graduate Admissions(in Japanese)](https://www.sal.tohoku.ac.jp/jp/admissions/grad/)
        - Please note that admission exams are required for both master’s and PhD applicants. You can find the previous exam questions on the above page.
        - For international students who wish to apply to the PhD program, you may also consider applying through the IGSAL program, which offers October enrollment.

## What I'm Looking For

I am looking for candidates who meet the following criteria (though candidates are not required to meet every item):

- Strong interest in computational social science
- Basic knowledge of social science theories and empirical research methods
- Experience with data analysis (e.g., text mining, network analysis)
- Programming skills (e.g., Python, R)

## Advising Philosophy

- **Student autonomy**: I encourage students to develop their own research directions and take ownership of their projects.

- **Collaborative relationship with students**: I aim to build a collaborative working relationship with students. In particular, when a student’s interests closely align with my current research, I hope—while fully respecting their own goals and preferences—to engage in active joint research.

## Scholarships Opportunities

Currently, some of the students I advise receive financial support through scholarships and fellowships such as the JSPS DC Research Fellowships, the Tohoku University Advanced Graduate School, and MEXT. I actively support students in applying for a wide range of funding opportunities (however, I cannot guarantee a dedicated source of financial support.)

## Notice for PhD Applicants

Students must publish or have accepted for publication at least **2** original research papers as the primary author in peer-reviewed academic journals/proceedings to complete the doctoral program and acquire a doctoral degree.

- **Primary author** implies First author, co-first author, or corresponding author.
- Paper should be published as primary author at the journals/proceedings listed below:
    - Journals that had been indexed at SCIE or SSCI.
    - Proceedings that had been indexed at CCF (The List of International Academic Periodicals Recommended by CCF).
    - Other peer-reviewed journals approved by instructors.
- Papers accepted with conditions will be deemed as equivalent to an accepted work, however, it must be accepted for publication before the time of the Final Examination.
